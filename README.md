Worked on an end-to-end logistics and transportation cost optimization model for Phillips Corporation, a global distributor of electrical components. The company sources containers of parts monthly from three European ports—Antwerp, Cherbourg, and Barcelona—and ships them to four U.S. ports—Boston, Savannah, Mobile, and Houston. From there, containers are moved via intermodal freight to inland ports (Ohio, Texas, North Carolina), and finally dispatched to five distribution centers across the U.S. (Phoenix, Columbus, Kansas City, Louisville, Memphis).
